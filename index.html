    <h2>Quotes that inspire me</h2>
    <blockquote>
        When you practice being a spectacular performer long enough, Spectacularity will become
        your way of being.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        The swiftest way to expand your limits is to push to the edges of your limits.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        YES, your transformation will be hard.<br/>
        YES, you will feel frightened, messed up and knocked down.<br/>
        YES, you will want to stop.<br/>
        YES, IT'S THE BEST WORK YOU"LL EVER DO.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        As you draw closer to your vision, setbacks will appear. Greatness tests the dreamers. Relentlessness is
        the price Legendary Performers pay to get Epic Things done.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Look how far you've come.<br/>
        Consider all that you have endured.<br/>
        Celebrate the trials you have withstood.<br/>
        Honor the summits you have scaled.<br/>
        You may feel a little battered.<br/>
        But you'll see that your pain has purified <br/>
        your POTENTIAL.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        The 4 Primary Mentalities of MASTERS<br/>
        #1. I'll learn the skills to rise to iconic.<br/>
        #2. I'll put in the training to become the best.<br/>
        #3. I'll stay true to the vision past the point of reason.<br/>
        #4. I'll always think like a beginner.
